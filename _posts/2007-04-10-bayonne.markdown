A document written by me in 2002. I used Dialogic cards to build a IVRS at that time. This document shows some detail on the hardware and OS configuration.

This is the [PostScript version](/img/bayonne_linux_dialogic_howto.ps) and [LaTeX source](/img/bayonne_linux_dialogic_howto.tex) and [HTML version](/img/bayonne_linux_dialogic_howto.html)
