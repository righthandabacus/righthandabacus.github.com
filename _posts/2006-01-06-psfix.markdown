If you want to create a postscript file from a MS Windows machine, the easiest
way to do is to get a PS printer installed then choose "print to file" in the
dialog box. However, the output is not very conformant to the PS standard and it
may look worse in ghostview.

The way of fixing is easy:

  - Edit the PS File, remove the first few lines until you see the fingerprint line:  `%!PS-Adobe`
  - Loop until you finish the whole file
    - Search for the line `%%BeginPageSetup`
    - Before this line, add a line `%%Page: 1 1` or `%%Page: 2 2` and so on, where the number is the page number
