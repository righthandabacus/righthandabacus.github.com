On last Friday, I held a "bookclub" meeting with Prof Ng et al. I learnt from him about a strategy: 3-by-4.

The 3-by-4 means that, take 3 time a week, spend 4 hours consecutively to do one thing. He said, many many one-hour slot cannot make any use. A few long time slot, however, can let you concentrate and do something great.

True. Very true.
