In the past, I used to use the VMware GSX server (my university paid a lot of
money for that!). I haven't been using it for a while but now, as I want to try
out something with my new Athlon64 Dell, I picked it up again.

Some how, the GSX series is discontinued and VMware is only selling ESX. The
original GSX becomes *VMware Server* and it is now a freeware! Great!

I downloaded and filled out an online form for a free serial number[^SN], but
the vmmon and vmnet modules failed to compile for my kernel. I guess it is
simply a problem of kernel code change since the VMware modules are programmed
(this happens a lot in the history). After some kernel code hacking, the
solutions are:

```diff
diff -uwr vmmon-only/linux/driver.c.old vmmon-only/linux/driver.c
