Euclid's formula says that, $$(a,b,c)$$ are a Pythagorean triple, i.e.,
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$ for $$a,b,c$$ are integers, if and only if $$a=2mn$$, $$b=m^2-n^2$$,
$$c=m^2+n^2$$ for some integers $$m,n$$.

The proof is as follows: Since $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$, we have

$$
\big(\frac{a}{c}\big)^2 + \big(\frac{b}{c}\big)^2 = 1
$$

i.e., the point $$P=(x,y)=(a/c,b/c)$$ is on the unit circle. Assume $$a,b,c$$ are
all non-negative. Hence P is in the first quadrant. Consider the point
$$Q=(0,-1)$$ on the unit circle, we have line QP intersect with the $$x$$-axis on
$$R=(k,0)$$, which, by section formula, we have

$$
k = \frac{x}{1+y}.
$$

Since $$x$$ and $$y$$ are rational numbers, so does $$k$$. Now we assume $$k=n/m$$ for
some non-negative $$n,m$$. Obviously, point $$R$$ is inside the unit circle, so
$$n\le m$$. Now consider the line QR, it is given by the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
(y-0)(0-k)&=(x-k)(-1-0) \\
x-ky-k &= 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

and the unit circle is given by

$$
x^2+y^2 = 1.
$$

Solving the two equations simultaneously, it gives the solution $$x=0,y=-1$$, i.e. point $$Q$$, and the other solution is

$$
\begin{aligned}
x&=\frac{2k}{1+k^2} & y&=\frac{1-k^2}{1+k^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Subsititute $$k=n/m$$ we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
x&=\frac{2\frac{n}{m}}{1+\frac{n^2}{m^2}} & y&=\frac{1-\frac{n^2}{m^2}}{1+\frac{n^2}{m^2}} \\
x&=\frac{2mn}{m^2+n^2} & y&=\frac{m^2-n^2}{m^2+n^2} \\
x&=\frac{a}{c} & y&=\frac{b}{c}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
a&=2mn & b&=m^2-n^2 & c&=m^2+n^2.
\end{aligned}
$$
