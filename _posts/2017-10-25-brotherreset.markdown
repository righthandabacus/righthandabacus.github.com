Reset the toner print count on Brother printer: The toner cartridge doesn't
seem to carry counting chip. But the counter is held in the printer itself. To
reset it, we have to go to service mode:

1. Turn off printer and open front cover
2. Press and hold the cancel button and then turn on printer
3. While still holding the cancel and the printer booted up, press the reprint button

The service menu is up, and we can scroll around
**C**yan - **Y**ellow - **M**aganta - **B**lack, each with **S**tandard and **H**igh-yield
count. Pick the right one to reset and press OK.
