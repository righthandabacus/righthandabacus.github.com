BCube is a recursive structure so that:

  - BCube($0$) is a $n$-port switch connects $n$ servers
  - BCube($k$) consists of $n$ units of BCube($k-1$) and $n^k$ units of $n$-port switch,
    in total $n^{k+1}$ servers and $(k+1)n^k$ switches

Building BCube($k$) from BCube($k-1$) are as follows: We number the BCube($k-1$) from $1$ to $n$ and in each BCube($k-1$), number the server from 1 to $n^k$. Then, considering the $n$ switches in the layer $k$, we connect the $i$-th server in $j$-th BCube($k-1$) to the $j$-th port of the $i$-th switch.
