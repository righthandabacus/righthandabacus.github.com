Data access techniques to optimize code in modern processor:

  - Loop interchange: Do stride-1 access rather than stride-$N$ to leverage spatial locality
  - Loop fusion: Merge adjacent loop with same iteration space, a.k.a. loop jamming. Increases
     instruction-level parallelism and reduces loop overhead
  - Loop blocking: Transform a $(n+1)$-level nested loop into $(2n)$-level nested loop to improve data
    locality. An example is blocked algorithm for matrix multiply. Also known as loop tiling.
  - Prefetching: Some processor provide instructions to prefetch data into cache (without passing the
    data to CPU)

Data layout techniques to optimize code:

  - Array padding: To prevent conflict misses, pad data (e.g. one cache line) between two
    consecutively declared, power-of-2 arrays so that elements `A[i]` and `B[i]` uses different
    cache lines. Inter-array padding is between different arrays and intra-array padding is
    to reduce self-interferences.
  - Array merging: Also known as group and transpose. Instead of arrays `A` and `B`, create array
    `AB` which each element is a duo (e.g. `struct` in C)
  - Array transpose: To change column-access to row-access in row-major order arrays
  - Data copying: Temporary transpose array before intensive operations
