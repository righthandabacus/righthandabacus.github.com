[Zotac ID 12](https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/id12) hardware spec:

- Intel Atom CPU D525 @1.8GHz (x64, dualcore, hyperthreading, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3)
- 4GB memory (204-pin SO-DIMM DDR3-800 x2, max 4GB)
- Intel GMA 3150 graphics
- HDMI and VGA output
- SATA II storage
- 6-in-1 card reader (MMC/SD/SDHC/MS/MS Pro/xD)
- Realtek RTL8169 Ethernet (10/100/1000Mbps)
- Atheros AR9285 Wireless (802.11n/g/b)
- Audio, bluetooth, CIR infrared port, USB 2.0 (6 ports), eSATA

# Install Debian
Making bootable SD card: Use `dd` in Linux as OSX will have input file size >
output size:

    dd if=debian.iso of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=4M
    sync

Install barebone Debian on it. All hardware should work immediately. Extra
packages to install:

- xserver-xorg
- kodi-standalone
- xinit

# Install kodi
The kodi packages are available from the following apt source:

```
deb http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie main non-free
deb http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie-backports main
```

Because Debian is using `systemd`, the following script should be added to
`/etc/systemd/system/kodi.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description = Kodi Open Source Home Theatre
# After = syslog.target

[Service]
User = kodi
Group = kodi
PAMName = login
TTYPath=/dev/tty7
StandardInput = tty
Type = simple
Restart = always
RestartSec = 5
KillMode = process
ExecStart = /usr/bin/xinit /usr/bin/kodi-standalone -- :0 -nolisten tcp vt7

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```

which a dedicated user `kodi` should be added for this:

    adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login --gecos "" kodi
    usermod -a -G cdrom,audio,video,plugdev,users,dialout,dip,input,netdev kodi

and finally reconfigure X11 to allow anyone (i.e., kodi) to start X server

    dpkg-reconfigure x11-common

Then enable and start kodi:

    systemctl enable kodi
    systemctl start kodi

# Stretch upgrade
(update 2017-12-27) The box was installed with jessie. Upgrade to stretch is to
change the apt source lists (both Debian itself and deb-multimedia). In fact,
kodi (17.1) is available in stretch's standard repository and deb-multimedia is no
longer necessary.

And Debian changed `/dev/tty*` to owned by group `tty`, hence kodi should be
added to that group as well
