You can learn a lot of photo retouching techniques in this book. Normally (actually I've read quite a number in Chinese) a photo retouching books tells you how to retouch a photo step by step. This book is different, it tells you why you have to do that.

Basically the first one-third of the book is the most important part. It tells you about the color space (RGB and CYMK system) and the principles in retouching. The rest of the book are just examples step-by-step.
