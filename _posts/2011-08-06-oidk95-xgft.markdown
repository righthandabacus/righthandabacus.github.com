This paper gives a generalized description of fat tree topology, and invented the notation:

$$ XGFT(h;m_1,m_2, ..., m_h; w_1, w_2, ..., w_h) $$

This notation means the fat tree has height $$h$$, and on level $$i$$ ($$0\le i\le h-1$$) each node has $$w_{i+1}$$ parent nodes and $$m_i$$ children nodes. Level 0 is the bottom-most layer, so assumed $$m_0=0$$. So for the degree-3 fat-tree that I always use, it can be expressed by $$XGFT(3;3,3,6;1,3,3)$$.
