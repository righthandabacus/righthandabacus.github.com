Risk of exchange rate fluctuation: Insulated by futures and options 
contracts
 - available for businesses in developed economies
 - other: government need to manage exchange rate

Central bank:
  - buy its own currency in forex market = support exchange rate, side effect: reducing money supply
  - buying domestic bonds = increase money supply
      - purchase in forex + buying domestic bonds = sterilize its action on money supply

Capital control: Taxes or restrictions on international transactions in 
assets like stocks or bonds

Exchange control: capital controls applied specifically to foreign 
exchange
  - The conventional wisdom of the economics profession has been that capital
    controls are ineffective and impose substantial costs.
  - China government: willing and able to rigorously enforce capital 
    controls on both inflows and outflows; and which maintains substantial
    control over the domestic financial system, capital controls are more likely
    to be effective
  - Regulate outflow: domestic purchase of foreign assets
  - Regulate inflow: foreign purchases of domestic assets (reduces the 
    amount of hot money, which likely to move out in a crisis, and 
    thereby facilitates the controls on outflows)

Price of a stable exchange rate: unstable short-term interest rates

Balance of payments of a country [^BOP] [^Wiki]:
  - BOP = Current account + Broadly defined capital account
  - IMF definition: BOP = current account + capital account + financial account
  - current account: country's trade balance (include income from loans 
    and investments or transfer payments)
      - current account balance = national saving -- national investment
  - capital account: transactions of capital assets, no impact on country's
    production, rate of savings, or income
    - domestic ownership of foreign assets and foreign ownership of domestic assets
    - broadly definied: include central bank reserves; otherwise exclude
  - credit in current account = debit in capital account, vice versa
  - Balancing BOP:
    - raise exchange rate, hurt export & make import cheaper, also make 
      domestic investment assets less attractive
    - inflation, make export less competitive

Foreign Investment [^FI]:
  - Direct investment: Establishing a direct business interest
  - Portfolio investment: Investing in financial assets such as stocks or bonds

Businesses and currency exchange rate
  - Chinese goods cheaper compared to their U.S. counterparts, making it more
    difficult for the U.S. firms to compete in common markets
  - Chinese export (peaked in 2008) → Growth
  - Growth + high domestic savings rate → current account surpluses + capital account deficit
      - high saving, high export = low import, thus current account surplus
      - capital account deficit = accumulation of foreign exchange reserve
  - Chinese capital control + capital account deficit = internationally 
    denominated bonds held by authorities (became foreign exchange reserves)
      - low rate of return asset, but very liquid
      - forex reserve help defend domestic currency against speculative attack
        or to recapitalize the domestic banking system in case of a financial crisis

China export declined in 2009--2015
  - forecasted real growth decline → forecasted interest rate & demand of CNY decline
  - current account surplus at 2--4% GDP (still healthy)
  - capital account declined: balances on direct/portfolio/other 
    investment become more negative
  - result: decline in forex reserve (selling USD to maintain CNY value) since June 2014
     - Chinese firms repaying fireign debt
     - Chinese resident seeking to hold foreign assets
     - switch of ownership of foreign assets from official to private Chinese portfolios
  
Chen and Orlik (2016)[^CO16] calculate the adequacy of Chinese foreign exchange reserves
under alternative assumptions about the effectiveness of Chinese capital controls.
  - IMF recommendation: depends on exchange rate is floating or fixed 
  and whether has effective capital control
  - IMF methodology: weighted average of exports, short-term foreign 
  debt, other foreign libabilities, and money supply
  - China: fixed exchange rate regime
      - if capital control effective: reserve should equal to 10% 
      annual export + 30% short-term debt + 20% other foreign 
      liabilities + 5% of M2 (USD $1.8 Tn)
      - if capital control ineffective: need $2.9 trillion
      - PBOC held $3.3 trillion as of December 2015

Maintain exchange rate target and economic conditions created a demand 
for foreign assets and drained reserves
  - Problem can be solved by positive shocks, e.g., an increase in expected
    growth that raises demand for domestic assets, without the need for 
    a major policy change

Four policy choices to stem reserve losses:
  - tighten capital controls: reduce demand for foreign assets
  - tighter monetary policy (higher interest rates): reduce demand for foreign assets
  - devalue the CNY substantially
  - continuing to sell off reserves gradually and hoping that conditions improve

Tighten capital control:
  - people are ingenious at moving money around
  - imperfect capital controls tend to become “leakier ” over time.
  - Tightening capital controls would counter to the longer-run goal to reduce
    financial regulation and increase the international use of CNY
  - interfere with the efficient allocation of resources, at the cost 
    of Chinese residents; no measurable effect on U.S. economy

Monetary or fiscal policy:
  - Tighter monetary policy and expansive fiscal policy have opposite effects
    on GDP but both tend to raise domestic interest rates and thereby 
    strengthen the CNY
      - both: expand money supply to encourage economic growth
      - fiscal policy (government): tax cut, rebates, govenment spending
      - monetary policy (PBOC): open market operations, reserve 
        requirements, interest rates
  - significant fiscal expansion = expensive and increase the debt-to-GDP ratio
      - fiscal policy takes time to formulate and implement and is difficult to adjust rapidly
  - monetary tightening would have the very undesirable side effect of slowing domestic growth
      - Growth remains a major priority for the Chinese authorities
      - PBOC maintain liquidity and steady credit growth
  - have effects on GDP, impacts U.S. exports, but U.S. exports to China account
    for only a very small proportion

Devalue the CNY:
  - Asset shift to non-CNY assets
      - tighter capital controls would seek to prevent markets from 
        making this asset shift
      - monetary or fiscal policy would change the fundamentals to make 
        asset demand consistent with the desired exchange rate
      - devalue CNY substantially to reduce domestic purchases of 
        foreign assets by making them more expensive and presumably 
        reducing expectations of future returns
  - if such a devaluation is to reduce fear of future devaluation, it must be substantial
      - small devaluation that simply increases expectations of future devaluations 
  - often find that such devaluations provoke inflation
  - let CNY float freely: Chinese business have to cope with the uncertainty about the future exchange rate

Defer a decision and continue to sell off reserves
  - sell off their foreign exchange reserves to domestic residents
  - entire forex reserve portfolio: $3 trillion
      - USD 1.8 trillion in U.S. securities (USD 1.25 trillion treasuries, 
        USD 500 billion agency and corporate debt)
      - sale of the whole $3 trillion forex reserve might raise U.S. 
        yields by 20--30 b.p. along the yield curve
      - if sales is merely a transfer of assets from Chinese 
        authorities to Chinese residents, they might not have any effect at all
  - effect of a sale probably much smaller than QE: Chinese sale of 
    U.S. assets cannot signal market participants about future Federal Reserve policy
