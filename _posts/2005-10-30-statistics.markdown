This is a very concise book on Statistics. It is also enjoyable to read (probably due to the cartoons). It takes only around one or two days to finish the whole, however, it covers a lot of topics that you may need for statistics. Of course, you should never expect any cutting-edge knowledge from a book of this style, but as an introductory test, it is excellent.
