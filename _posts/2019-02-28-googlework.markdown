## 第１章　世界より速く動くための仕事術

- Finish the job in one shot: Do not procrastinate if you can do something, and do as much as you can
- Use Google Doc to allow work done on the premise whenever we need to
- Set deadline for tasks: We can’t focus and schedule without a deadline
  - ASAP is a red flag, it will never be done
- Strategy for tasks can’t finish immediately:
  - Sort out items “understood” vs “need to figure out” and focus on former
  - Ask for clarification
  - Put it down for a rest
- Instead of email, use Google Doc for real-time collaboration
  - Email = asynchronous, slow
  - Avoided hassles of versioning and renaming filenames

## 第６章　グーグルの疲れない働き方
