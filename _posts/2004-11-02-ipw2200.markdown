My laptop is running Centrino with the IPW2200 as the Wi-Fi. Here, I describe
the way to build a kernel to support it.

Firstly, download the kernel source, definitely. At the time of writing, I used
the kernel version 2.6.8.1 for that. Afterwards, several things more to do:

  - Download the IPW2200 driver from <http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net>. At the time of writing, it is version 0.7 and named `ipw2200-0.7.tgz`
  - Extract the kernel source, and go to `drivers/net/wireless`, then extract `ipw2200-0.7.tgz` here
  - Rename the directory `ipw2200-0.7` to just `ipw2200`
  - Back to the root of your kernel source, and run this command: `patch -p1 < drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200/patches/ipw2200-2.6.8-patch`
  - `make menuconfig` and make up your components, then build
  - Finished

With a new kernel supporting Wi-Fi, and with the firmware (downloaded from
<http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net>) placed inside `/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware`,
I've did `modprobe ipw2200` and a new Wi-Fi device is up.

Afterwards, I can simply use the wireless tools (e.g. `iwconfig`, `iwlist`) to set
up other stuff and play.
