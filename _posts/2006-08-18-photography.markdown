This is a great (as in size) book. It tells you something very fundamental on how to take a good picture. It tells you how a photograph works (no, not from a physicist's but from an artist's point of view).

If you wanna make your picture with correct exposure, coloring, white balance and looks nice, this is the book that can tell you how to do so and what are the clues to do well.
