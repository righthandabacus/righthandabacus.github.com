This paper describes the case when the congestion window of a TCP is greater than the BDP. The BDP is defined as the bottleneck bandwidth multiplies by the end-to-end propagation delay. It finds that, in such scenario, the TCP is undergoing self-clocking transfer which means the cwnd does not play an important role in the sending speed but the bottleneck bandwidth is.
