I learn about this paper because of [nude.js](http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/nudejs/).

This paper proposes an algorithm to classify nude pictures. Firstly, it classify pixels in a picture as "skin" and "non-skin". Then connect the skin pixels into skin regions. For the largest three skin regions, make a bounding polygon (indeed only a quadrilateral as it takes only the leftmost, rightmost, uppermost and lowermost pixels). Base on the skin regions and the polygon, a picture contains nudity unless any of the following is met:

  * Total skin pixels <15% pixels in a picture
  * Largest skin region has <35% total skin pixels AND 2nd largest has <30% AND 3rd largest has <30%
  * Largest skin region has <45% total skin pixels
  * Total skin pixels <30% pixels in a picture AND skin pixels in the bounding polygon <55% size of polygon
  * Number of skin regions >60 AND average intensity within polygon <0.25

In the last bullet, intensity is the saturation value in HSV space. Converting from RGB to HSV is given by the following formulae:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H &= \arccos\frac{\frac{1}{2}[(R-G)+(R-B)]}{\sqrt{(R-G)^2+(R-B)(G-B)}} \\
S &= 1 - 3\frac{\min(R,G,B)}{R+G+B} \\
V &= \frac{1}{3}(R+G+B)
\end{aligned}
$$
