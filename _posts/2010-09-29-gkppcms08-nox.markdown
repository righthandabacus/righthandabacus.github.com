NOX, Network Operating System, is proposing an "OS" layer on top of network hardware. Similar to OS in a computer, it abstracts the network functions into API and user can write "applications" on top of those API to control the network. The idea is to make network management easier by providing a middle layer and a central point to hold network-wide view.
