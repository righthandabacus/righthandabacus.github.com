Recently I am looking for some JavaScript grid components to use. Preferably to work like Excel or Calc in OpenOffice.org.

Googling tells about a product called [dhtmlxGrid](http://www.scbr.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/), which has the version 1.4 release one week ago. I downloaded, but the documentation sucks. Hence I wrote my own below.

## License

The site said it is distributed in GPL. However, I found some Yahoo! produced code inside which said it is in BSD. They are not compatible, however!

But I just use it anyway, un-seriously.

## Initialization

The simplest case of use is as follows:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/dhtmlXCommon.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/dhtmlXGrid.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/dhtmlXGridCell.js"></script>

<div id="gridbox"></div>
<script>
<!--
        // Note: Must set the height
        document.getElementById('gridbox').style.height = "600px";
        // Create the grid
        var mygrid = new dhtmlXGridObject('gridbox');
        // Columns' header
        mygrid.setHeader("alpha,beta,gamma,delta,epsilon,eta");
        // Columns' width
        mygrid.setInitWidths("100px,100px,100px,100px,100px,100px");
        // Initialize and load data
        mygrid.init();
        mygrid.loadXML("grid.xml");
//-->
</script>
```

Which will show the grid on the DIV with id `grid`. The height is essential because it controls how many rows to display. If not specified, only the column headers will be shown!

The column headers is essential because it counts how many columns to display. The `loadXML()` function can actually pass on a very big table but only the first few columns are shown. If the headers are not specified, no columns will be displayed and hence you get a null grid.

The column width is essential as well or otherwise, width of zero is assumed and all columns overlaps.
