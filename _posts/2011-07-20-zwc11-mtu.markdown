A short paper that proposes to use a smaller MTU to solve the incast problem.
As the buffer size is fixed, a smaller packet means the buffer can hold more
packets, and then it allows the TCP window to be "larger". A larger TCP window
is easier to catch packet drops by duplicated acknowledgement. Therefore make
it less possible to have TCP timeout.
