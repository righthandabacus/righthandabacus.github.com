Imagine a Metro-Ethernet, if ARP is allowed to broadcast, the broadcast storm
would be tremendous. In this paper, it assumes that the consumer edge (CE) and
provider edge (PE) switches have a cache for the forwarding table. The cache is
to remember the IP-MAC address association it ever encountered (e.g. by
intercepting ARP requests and replies, and by sniffing the packets passing
through the switch). Later on, whenever an ARP request arrives, instead of
broadcast it to all other ports of the switch, it sends the reply to the sender
directly using its local information.
