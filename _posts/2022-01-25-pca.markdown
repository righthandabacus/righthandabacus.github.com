Assume we have a family of $$n$$ assets whose daily return is vector $$\mu$$
and the covariance matrix is $$\Sigma$$. If we make a portfolio whose asset
weight is $$w_k$$ for asset $$k$$ and the vector of all weights is $$w$$, then
the portfolio's volatility is $$\sigma = (w^\top\Sigma w)^{1/2}$$.

Now, for matrix $$\Sigma$$, we can have spectral decomposition

$$
\Sigma V = V \Lambda
$$

where $$V$$ is matrix of columns of eigenvectors and $$\Lambda$$ is a diagonal
matrix of eigenvalues (in descending order), both of $$\Sigma$$. Hence we can
write $$\Sigma = V \Lambda V^\top$$. Substitute this into the formula for the
square of volatility, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 &= w^\top \Sigma w \\
&= w^\top (V\Lambda V^\top) w \\
&= (w^\top V) \Lambda (V^\top w)
\end{aligned}
$$

if we substitute $$u = V^\top w$$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 &= (w^\top V) \Lambda (V^\top w) \\
&= u^\top \Lambda u
\end{aligned}
$$

Now since $$\Lambda$$ is diagonal,

$$
\Lambda = \text{diag}\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_1 & \lambda_2 & \dots & \lambda_n\end{pmatrix}
$$

with $$\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge \dots \ge \lambda_n$$, therefore

$$
\sigma^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n u_k^2\lambda_k
$$

This is significant because normally the variance $$\sigma^2$$ is not additive
but we can make it so by looking at the eigenvector dimensions. Also,
if $$\Sigma$$ is positive definite ([usually the case for covariance matrix](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52976/))
then $$\lambda_k > 0$$ for all $$k$$. This is a useful information on the
problem of finding the minimal $$\sigma^2$$ subject to some constraint on
$$u$$. Assume we have the condition that $$\sum_k u_k=C$$ for some
constant $$C>0$$, it is trivial to see that the way to minimize $$\sigma^2$$ is
to make $$u_k=0$$ for $$k=1,\dots,n-1$$ and $$u_n=C$$. In this case,
the portfolio volatility is $$\sigma = u_n\sqrt{\lambda_n} = C\sqrt{\lambda_n}$$.
In this case, $$C$$ is just a scaling factor for the size of the portfolio.
If we have $$u$$, it is easy to reverse it to get

$$
w = V u.
$$

Since $$V$$ and $$\Lambda$$ are the eigenvector and eigenvalues of $$\Sigma$$, 
we can consider the mutually orthogonal eigenvectors are different "risk
dimensions" and a portfolio is constructed so as to distribute the total risk
to these different dimensions. In this case, we can write
$$R=\begin{pmatrix}r_1 & r_2 & \dots & r_n\end{pmatrix}$$ as a vector of risk
proportions to each dimension and the risk distribution satisfies

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_k &= \frac{u_k^2 \lambda_k}{\sigma^2} \\
u_k &= \sqrt{\frac{r_k\sigma^2}{\lambda_k}} = \sigma\sqrt{\frac{r_k}{\lambda_k}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence we can construct a portfolio with arbitrary allocation of risk to each
dimensions.
