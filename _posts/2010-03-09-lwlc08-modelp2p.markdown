The PFTK formula gives the steady state throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow as a function of loss rate and RTT:  

$$
B(p,RTT) = \dfrac{MSS}{RTT\sqrt{\frac{2bp}{3}+T_0\min(1,3\sqrt{\frac{3bp}{8})p(1+32p^2)}}}=\dfrac{MSS}{RTTf(p)}
$$

where $b$ is the number of packets that are acknowledged by a received ACK and $T_0$ is the initial value of the timeout.

TBC.
