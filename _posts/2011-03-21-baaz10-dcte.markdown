In DCN, congestion occurs in only up to a few seconds. This congestion can be alleviated if optimal routing is used. However, existing traffic engineering technique fail to provide any of the following:

  - Utilize multipath diversity
  - Adapt to instantaneous load
  - Use a global view to make routing decisions

This paper propose to monitor traffic at NICs and couple with OpenFlow to do MicroTE. The architecture is as follows:

  - Top-of-rack switch or end-hosts monitor traffic and gather statistics.
  - Controller collect statistics, either by polling switches regularly or end-hosts feed data to controllers
  - Controller compile the global view of network and send to routing component
  - Routing component computes route
  - If new route is different from current one significantly, new route is used, though OpenFlow update.
