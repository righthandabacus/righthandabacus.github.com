# Scaling a Development Team

Read the [blog post](http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/28/scaling_a_development_team/) by Adam Wiggins. He talked about the experience at his company on how to scale a team. TL;DR is no silver bullet development model and the model shall change as the team size scales.

Stage 1: Homebrewing

  - 2-4 guy working in a garage
  - easy communication and coordination
  - self-directed generalist working on everything
  - single chat channel and single (unclassified) mailing list
  - no need for bug-tracking, a complete picture of the project is in everyone's brain
  - target for minimum viable product

Stage 2: First hires

  - 5-9 person
  - ad-hoc coordination: overhear everything from each other
  - iteration planning: start having Monday meetings, big to-do list on whiteboard, system for task-assignment
  - bureaucracy is definitely counter-productive
  - single chat channel and mailing list still works
  - everyone is still a generalist, but have a common focused goal
  - in search of a scalable business model

Stage 2.5:

  - 10-15 developers, many startups have been killed here
  - people start to spend most of their time on iteration planning and meetings
  - bored to go through laundry lists of details on other people's work
  - need to break down one team into smaller target teams

Stage 3: Breaking teams

  - the art: Draw the fences in the right place
  - need a well-defined sphere of authority and clear interfaces to other teams
  - a team should have maximum autonomy and have their vision and direction
  - needs no permission or information from other teams unless a feature/bug across team boundaries
  - shall have a product/market fit, and have found the company's meaning for existence
  - starts to appreciate specialization and specialists
