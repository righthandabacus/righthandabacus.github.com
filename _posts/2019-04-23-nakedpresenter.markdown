TLDR: A book on presentation. Not on slides, but on how to give a presentation
in person, and how to engage the audience to the topic

## Chapter 2: Preparation

- Identify your audience before your talk
- The why: What's my point and why does it matter
  - many presenter focus on what, some focus on how, but seldom on why
  - why = big picture
- rehearse, tell a story
  - story = identify a problem, identify the causes, how and why you solved the problem
- Aristotle on good public speaking
  1. Appeals to reason
  2. Appeals to emotions
  3. Appeals based on the character and personality of the speaker
- Deep or wide? One-hour lecture is too short to go both direction
- Preparation process
  1. Quiet time and place
  2. Remove distractions
  3. Go analog: Grab a book, sticky notes, index cards
  4. Identify core point
     - topic is a noun phase, core point is a full sentence to take home
  5. Brainstorm
  6. Consolidate, edit, and group your ideas into three sections
  7. Sketch your visuals
  8. Build visuals on software

## Chapter 3: Connect with Punch, Presence, and Projection

- Opening punch to hook the audiences
- Personal, Unexpected, Novel, Challenging, Humorous
- Never start with an apology
- Do not show the structure, but hint or articulate
- Presence = Focus on here and now
  - do not concern for failure or success
  - honest conversation creates stronger connections with the audience
    - remove worries about the outcomes, you are able to be your natural self and audiences will know the difference
    - you are not reading a speech
- Projection = Lasting connection (impression about you)
  - the way you look, move, and sound
  - eye contact

## Chapter 4: Engage with Passion, Proximity, and Play

- Show passion: put your heart and soul into it
  - show you are interested rather than to make it interesting
  - our brains are activated by the movements and feelings of others
- Presenter is an artist on stage, performance with great content, powerful
  visuals, and emotional touch to make a lasting connection with the audience
- Story of the 1984 commercial of Apple
  - exhibits solid conflicts and contrasts
  - emotions: use stories and examples
  - sell experience, not the features of the thing itself
- Interact using proximity
  - stay closer to the audiences
  - come out from the barriers, use a remote
- Sir Ken Robinson on public speaking
  - speaking to individuals not an abstract group
  - relax
  - be conversational and make connection
  - know your material
  - prepare but not rehearse (so don't lose the natural connection with the audiences)
  - leave room for improvisation
  - humor is for engagement: if they are laughing then they are listening
- Spirit of play improves learning and stimulates creative thinking
  - humor leans to joyfulness, leads to productivity
  - play: exploration and discovery

## Chapter 5: Sustain with Pace and Participation

- Attention span: 18 minutes, or shorter
  - the 10-minute rule, then do something to change things up to keep people engaged
  - give the brain a break every 10 minutes
- Slow down the rate of speaking
  - natural to speak too fast, as a result of increased adrenaline
- Make use of variation in rate, volume, pitch
  - read the situation and make adjustments on the spot
- Never go overtime (80% full)
- Participation
  - "Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn" (Benjamin Franklin)
  - Have your audience do something, give them an experience
  - e.g., ask questions
- Steve Jobs presentations
  - Walks on stage, confident but humble: Establish connection with audiences
  - No agenda slide, but give people an idea where you're going ("I've got four things I'd like to talk about")
    - SJ often structures his talks around 3-4 parts with one theme
  - Show your enthusiasm: Believe what he says, sincere, authentic
  - Be positive, upbeat, humorous
  - Not about numbers, but what the numbers mean
    - break down numbers, compares it
  - Make it visual
  - Introduce something unexpected
  - Include only what is necessary
  - Vary the pace and change techniques: Mixes in video clips, images, stories, data, etc.
  - Save the best for last
  - Go the appropriate length

## Chapter 6: End with a Powerful Finish

- Sticky ending: Simple, concrete, unexpected, credible
- Take it back to the beginning
