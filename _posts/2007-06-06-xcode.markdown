Points to note on using gcc over Intel Mac:

  * gcc 3.3 is not working for Intel platform (no libraries available)
  * gcc 4.0 is the only thing that can link Intel code, due to the libraries' availability
  * packages to install (ref: XCode 2.4.1)
     * BSDSDK (command line handling stuff)
     * DevSDK (important: `/usr/lib/crt1.o` resides here)
     * gcc-4.0 (the working compiler)
     * gcc-3.3 (the required stuff, but not used by me)
  * the installed packages will store a receipt over `/Library/Receipts`
     * e.g. BSDSDK: `/Library/Receipts/BSDSDK.pkg`
     * a bill-of-materials (BOM) file contains a list of files installed by this package
     * to read BOM, use `lsbom`
     * e.g.: `lsbom -l -f -p f /Library/Receipts/BSDSDK.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom`
