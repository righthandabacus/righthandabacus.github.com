This paper proposed a server-centric method to connect a large number of servers to build a data center network.

The DPillar network requires a number of commodity legacy switch to connect servers with two NICs each (dual-port servers). The servers are workstations as well as intermediate nodes for relaying traffic. It connects the servers and switches to make it similar to a wrapped butterfly network.

In the paper, the routing algorithm and fault tolerance capabilities are discussed.
