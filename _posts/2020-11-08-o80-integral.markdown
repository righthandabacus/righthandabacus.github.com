This is an artcle of my recent acquaintance. It is about various integrals
involving the standard normal distribution $$\Phi(x)$$ and its derivative.
Besides it is a handy reference, it is interesting to see how the author
organize the hundreds of integrals in a manner that is easy to lookup.

The paper considers integrals in the general form

$$\int f(x) \Phi(a+bx)^c \Phi(bx)^d \phi(a+bx)^g \phi(bx)^h x^i dx$$

and 14 different functions $$f(x)$$ are considered. They are encoded by a
single (hexadecimal?) digit, such as $$f(x)=e^{ax}$$ is 1 and
$$f(x)=\ln\Phi(x)$$ is 6. Then, together with $$(c,d,g,h,i)$$, a 6-digit number
can be used to represent the integral. For example, number 001000 is

$$\int\Phi(bx)dx = x\Phi(bx)+\frac1b\phi(bx)$$

and number 100010 is

$$\int e^{cx}\phi(x)dx = e^{c^2/2}\Phi(x-c)$$

There is a different paper[^1] (based on error function erf() instead of
$$\Phi(x)$$) of similar nature but a bit more difficult to use as the integrals
are categorized in broad sections, and no such handy indexing is provided.
