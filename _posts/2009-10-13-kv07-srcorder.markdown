In OBS network, all-optical switching is done. It is possible to have multipath
in the network but when a TCP flow switched from a path to another, packet out
of order may occur and that make TCP (Reno) mistook as loss. The solution
proposed in this paper is that, because the optical switch know precisely the
delay differential $\delta$, upon switching paths, the optical switch can delay the
packet (bursts) for $\delta$, i.e. reorder the sending sequence in the old and new
path, to avoid packet out of order.
