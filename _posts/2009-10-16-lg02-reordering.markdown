A paper in the early year to investigate the effect of packet reordering to application throughput (esp. TCP). The conclusion is trivial but it gives some numbers:

> While at small reorder rates there is little effect, at rates starting from 0.1 to 1 percent (depending on the delay), a much fast drop in application throughput takes place
