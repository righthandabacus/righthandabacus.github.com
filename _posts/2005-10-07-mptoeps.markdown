The FAQ for MetaPost drawing is why ghostview cannot preview the picture but you
can still included in LaTeX. Actually, this is due to the fact that, MP output
is not a completely valid postscript, but just a partial file. Whenever you
included some text, it cannot understand where to find the font as the
font-related header is missing. No way to fix, this is a feature!

However, I know it is annoying and it make some begineers confused. But I found
two neat tools. First one is the `mptopdf` command, which is bundled in my
Debian. It can convert the MP file directly into PDF pictures. Suitable for
those `pdflatex` users. Another is the `mptoeps` Perl script, available at
<http://www.alcinoe.net/perl/mptoeps>, which do the same thing but for a completely
*valid* eps file. This probably help to relief some people's pain.
