I know there are tensorflow, pytorch, kera and a whole bunch of other libraries
out there but I need something that can work on [Termux](https://termux.com/)
but no success (at least no longer after Python 3.7 upgrade). But after reading
again the textbook on how a neural network operates, it doesn't seem hard to
write my own library.

I will update this post to elaborate. But the code above should be self-explanatory.
