From unlock to after flashing. To revitalize a old tablet.

# Step 1: unlock

- The system has build 10.6.1.27.5 (Android 4.2)
- Install Unlock tool v8 from Asus
- Delete Google account from Android as the unlock tool cannot compare the Google password anymore
- Run unlock tool, and let it remove the device
- During reboot, it shows message that it is being unlocked

# Step 2: move to fastboot mode
- power it down
- hold power + vol down key to power it up again
- It shows "RCK", android, and "wipe data" icons
- now the device is in "fastboot" mode (as indicated by the message at top left corner)

# Step 3: TWRP for recovery
- Download from <http://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-tf300t/development/recovery-twrp-t3046479>
- The file `twrp_tf300t_kang_2.8.7.2.img`
- Run these commands:

```
$ fastboot devices
015d15b4d723ee12        fastboot
$ fastboot -i 0x0B05 flash recovery twrp_tf300t_kang_2.8.7.2.img
sending 'recovery' (7126 KB)...
OKAY [  2.762s]
writing 'recovery'...
OKAY [  7.874s]
finished. total time: 10.636s
$ fastboot reboot
rebooting...

finished. total time: 0.020s
```

- Now the device has a stock ROM with custom recovery image

# Step 4: Make a backup before flashing

- Power down the device again and boot it up to fastboot mode once more
- With "RCK" icon flashing, push vol up button. The device should say "Booting recovery image"
- Then TWRP is being loaded
- Make a backup from TWRP, backup is at sdcard/TWRP directory and only the system, no user data
- The backup I see is 2255MB
- After back up, select "Reboot"

# Step 5: Installing a ROM

- Obtain from from <http://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-tf300t/development>
- ROM of choice = [`KatKiss-5.1_TF300T_029.zip`](http://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-tf300t/development/rom-t2932783)
- Other packages to download:
  - Gapps: `gapps-KatKiss-5.1_TF300T_20150920.zip`
  - Latest SuperSU: ``SuperSU.zip``
  - Sound improvements & misc : `K.A.T_V2.1.0.apk`
- Copy KatKiss, gapps to sdcard
- Unplug USB cable, boot into recovery mode (power+vol down, then vol up on RCK)
- Wipe data for factory reset
- Install, find the zip file for KatKiss, and confirm with that
- After install, alsow wipe cache and dalvick cache partitions
- Then install the gapps zip in similar way
- Then reboot
- Need to wait for some time at first boot
- Then configuration from scratch

# Post installation

- KatKiss doesn't work well with external SD cards
- Used Cyanogenmod CM12 instead
- Install apk failed in CM12, then needed to turn on developer mode, run adb shell, then:

```
su # to get root
pm set-install-location 1 # to install to internal instead of auto
chmod 777 /data/local
chmod 777 /data/loca/tmp  # fix permission problem
pm install /storage/sdcard1/path.to.apk  # do the install
exit # leave root
```

- Install by `pm install` must be in `/storage/sdcard1` instead of `/mnt/media_rw/sdcard1` because only the former is readable by non-root (the user of pm)
