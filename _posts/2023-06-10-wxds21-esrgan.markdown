This is to extend the SR-GAN and ESR-GAN to do blind super-resolution. The
problem statement is to reconstruct the high-resolution image from low
resolution (a.k.a. super-resolution), but without knowing how the low
resolution is derived from the original high-resolution image, i.e.,
*blind super-resolution*.

The contribution of this paper: (1) A process to create high-quality synthetic
dataset for super-resolution, (2) a network for SR, especially using U-Net in
the discriminator with spectral normalization to increase discriminator
capability.

The classical degradation model includes blur, downsampling, noise, and JPEG
compression:

$$
\mathbf{x} = D(\mathbf{y}) = [(\mathbf{y} \oast \mathbf{k})
$$

first-order vs high-order degradation modeling for real-world degradation
sinc filter for ringing and overshoot artifacts
discriminator of more powerful capability
gradient feedback from discriminator needs to be more accurate for local detail nehancement
U-net design with spectral normalization (SN) regularization
