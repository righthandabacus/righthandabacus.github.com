I learnt something interesting today: The skip list.

Skip list is a data structure that happens to do similar work as a tree.
However, to make a tree optimized for searching, it has to be balanced and
balancing is a cost. Skip list, however, does not enforce balancing but make the
"tree" probabilistically balanced.

Actually, it is not a tree, but a list. The nodes in the list has random number
of connections to decendent nodes. For example, node 1 may has three connections
and it is pointing to node 2, node 10 and node 15, node 2 has only one
connection and it is pointing to node 3. In general, node $$n$$ must point to node
$$n+1$$ but there may be some other connections to node $$n+k$$.

The more *levels of connections* you have, the faster you can search. Details
are mentioned in the following paper:

The sample code is also available from the author: <ftp://ftp.cs.umd.edu/pub/skipLists/>
