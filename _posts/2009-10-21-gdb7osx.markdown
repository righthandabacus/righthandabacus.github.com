GDB 7 is released. It is nice to know that it now supports Darwin systems, a.k.a. Mac OS X.

The only pitfall is that, there are somewhere in the source code written wrong
and need a minor tweak before compile. Precisely, all the `fprintf` call in
`opcodes/i386-disc.c` and `opcodes/ppc-disc.c` missed the format string `"%s"` after
the file descriptor. The patch can be obtained from Google searching "gdb 7 os
x". Afterwards, patch the system, configure with `--enable-64-bit-bfd` option,
and then make.

Now I can have a TUI-based, modern-time GDB. Nice.
