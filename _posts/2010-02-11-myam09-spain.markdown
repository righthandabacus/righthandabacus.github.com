This paper describes SPAIN, a method to build data center networks (load balanced networks) from commodity ethernet switches and specialized hosts.

The hosts are required with no special hardware but a specialized driver so that all the packets sending out are in a VLAN and all the hosts are capable of doing some kind of signalling to other hosts. The idea is, for all hosts to any other hosts, we find $$k$$ paths, preferably disjoin but not required, and combine them into a small number of VLAN spanning trees. Then the switches are configured with those VLANs with hand-coded forwarding tables. The host is then send packets with a per-flow random VLAN so that the traffic can be balanced. The merit of this paper is in the algorithm to combine paths into VLANs.

# Summary

Problem of ethernet:

  - Spanning tree
     - STP makes a tree, which means inefficient use of cross-sectional bandwidth
     - STP makes network susceptible to failure near root
     - Making STP network of high bandwidth need ultra-fast cores, which is expensive
  - Packet floods	
     - Ethernet learns and relearns the location of MAC
     - If packet's address is not known at the moment, packets are flood to all ports
  - Host broadcasts
     - Protocols such as ARP, DHCP relies on bcast

SPAIN: Use VLAN to select different trees, so that total comm. bandwidth can be larger than a single VLAN

VLAN building:

  - Find k paths from node s to node t, disjoint paths preferred, but not required
  - Among all the paths, build loop-free aggregates (VLAN trees)
     - Each path belongs to a unique tree
     - Number of trees are minimized
  - Optimal solution is NP-hard, so heuristic algorithm is used

Performance

  - Compare different topologies: FatTree, BCube, 2D HyperX, CiscoDC
  - The algorithm works good: Number of VLANs is close to optimal
  - The algorithm is doing stochastic VLAN packing, the time required is reasonable

Fault tolerance

  - Either by Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (Cisco) / Multiple Spanning Tree (IEEE 802.1s)
  - Or by end-host failure mechanisms
  - End-host failure mechanisms can do faster repair

FIB pinning: Directly program the FIB tables on the switches

  - Requires central knowledge of MAC locations
  - Program the VLAN map and FIB tables on all switches
  - Disadvantage: May produce a larger FIB table
     - If FIB is learning-based, unused host are not recorded
     - FIB pinning will always have an entry for all possible destinations
  - Typical switch FIB table: 16K entries on SRAM, 128K entries on DRAM

End host algorithm

  - Five goals:
     - Spread load
     - Minimize overhead of bcast and flooding
     - Detect and react to failures
     - Facilitate mobility (e.g. VM migration)
     - Enable incremental deployment
  - Send packet:
     - Select an usable VLAN and send (randomly select)
     - If no candidate VLAN, send on default VLAN (VLAN 1)
     - Probe on all candidate but not usable VLANs
        - Send unicast chirp message to the destination on a VLAN
        - Rx of chirp signals VLAN usable at rx side
        - Respond of chirp may be requested
  - Re-pinning: Change a flow's selected VLAN
     - Only in case of
        - Failure (immediate re-pin)
        - VM migration (immediate re-pin)
        - Improve load balance
        - Probe for revived VLANs
     - Re-pin algorithm for a flow
        - This host moved
        - My destination host moved
        - This flow is new
        - Non-TCP flow hasn't re-pinned for too long
        - TCP flow becomes too slow (cwnd < threshold) due to rexmit
  - Receive packet
     - If chirp packet, do respond as requested on unicast
     - Any incoming packet is a proof of the health of the source on this VLAN
     - If chirp hasn't been sent, send one to the source to signal for healthy VLAN
  - End hosts keeps the following information
     - VLAN in use for a dest switch (addr)
     - VLAN usable for a dest switch (addr)
     - These info are cleared periodically
  - Failure detection: By no packet received in VLAN
     - Stop using that VLAN for that destination
