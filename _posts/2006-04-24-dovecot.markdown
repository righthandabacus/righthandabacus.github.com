Recently, I changed the IMAP daemon used in IEAA server from UW-IMAPd (which is using mbox format) to Dovecot. The transition is easy, but not trivial as I originally expect. Here are the steps if you want to do so:

  - apt-get install dovecot-imapd, usually, your old imapd would be removed
  - then, edit `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf`, simply change the line `protocols=`, to make it support for imap protocol on 143 port
  - make sure `default_mail_env = mbox:%h/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u`, which should be suitable for most cases
  - now the most tedious thing: for every user, go to his home directory
    - create the directory `~/mail` to store the users' own mail box (non-INBOX boxes)
    - create `~/mail/.subscriptions` to list the mail boxes, which is exactly the same function (and format) as `~/.mailboxlist`, so you can simply issue
      `mv .mailboxlist mail/.subscriptions`
    - move the old mbox files to `~/mail`

Done.

BTW: If you're using any IMAP clients (e.g. Mozilla), better clean up all their cache or otherwise, there would be some strange behavior on the clients.
