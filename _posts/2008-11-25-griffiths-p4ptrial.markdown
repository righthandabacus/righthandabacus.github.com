P4P study by Comcast and Yale.

Impact of P4P: It can improve the speed of downloads to P2P clients and effective in localising P2P traffic within the Comcast's network.

P4P did not increase the upstream utilisation in the access network. The uploading behaviour is neutral to the use of P4P. Thus P4P is not a solution for the network congestion. However, P4P reduced outgoing traffic at peering points (because you don't need to exchange so much data with the peers?) significantly by 34%.

In terms of downstream utilisation, P4P reduced the incoming traffic by 80% at the peering points, while the download activity remains at the level. That means a significant portion of the download activity is fulfilled by the intra-domain transfer.
