This paper proposes two improvement to the Calendar Queue. The improvement is
targeting at the resizing mechanism.

First improvement is to detect uneven event distribution. The conventional
resize rule checks the total events in a queue and resize if it outsides a
bound. This suggested improvement keeps *encountered* event count which sums the
number of events seen in those buckets with new event enqueued. This may double
count a bucket but the objective is to calculate the average encountered events
which can infer uneven event distribution. If that average is above a threshold,
resize the calendar queue with bucket size changed.

Second improvement is to find the best bucket size. It keeps track on the bucket
with longest event queue and the event queue length in each bucket. Then the
buckets around the longest bucket are considered to compute the average
inter-event gap and this is the new bucket width.
