MD5 (Message Digest Five) is the algorithm developed by Rivest (of the RSA
fame). It is also documented in the RFC1321. In order for the completely free
use, L. Peter Deutsch wrote his own implementation according to the
specification of the RFC. Currently, his implementation can be found on
[Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc/).

I transformed Deutsch's implementation into C++. So that you
can call the MD5 in the following way:

```c++
#include "md5.h"

md5* MD5 = new md5();
cout << "MD5 of string 'hello' is " << MD5->digest('hello') << endl;
MD5->reset();
MD5->append('hello ');
MD5->append('world!');
cout << "MD5 of string 'hello world!' is " << MD5->getDigest() << endl;
```

The code is here: [C++ source](/img/md5.cc) and [header file](/img/md5.h)
