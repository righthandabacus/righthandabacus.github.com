Low-voltage ICs: 1.3V to 1.5V

SDRAM (synchronous dynamic random access memory) is made up of arrays of
storage (2D lattice of word lines intersecting with bit lines). Each grid is
called a bank.

One side of the DIMM housing make up one *rank*, which is a group containing
multiple banks. DDR is in groups of 2, DDR2 is in groups of 4, DDR3 is in
groups of 8. Usually each bank is in one IC.

If each row has 1K columns and each column stores 8 bits, and each IC has 8 cnotiguous banks, then each memory page is 8 KByte.

Bank n spread across the total number of ICs per rank. And in one IC, there is 8 distinct stacked banks.

DDR3 core has 8n-prefetch where n=number of banks per rank: each access reads a minimum of 8 bytes
