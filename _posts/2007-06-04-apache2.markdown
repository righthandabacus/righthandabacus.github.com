I helped my previous laboratory to move the server, and upgrade to Debian 4.0r0
with Apache 2. Upgrading to Apache 2 is somewhat tedious, because a lot of
configuration need to be changed. Below are two notes:

# Virtual Host

The correct way of doing in Apache 2 is:

```
NameVirtualHost *
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName www.site_one.net
    # Something else
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName www.site_two.net
    # Something else
</VirtualHost>
```

Note about the asterisk used. Only those labeled on `NameVirtualHost` can be
used in `VirtualHost` tag. These virtual host configuration is stored in
`/etc/apache2/sites-available` and a symlink is created in
`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`. Their use is self-explanatory.

# User Dir

The Debian's version of configuration file has some problem on the external
modules. Search for `modes-available` and you will see these:

    Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.load
    Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.conf

which means you should create symlinks of *both* `.load` and `.conf` files on
the `mods-enabled` directory. Actually you should have

    Include /etc/apache2/mods-available/*.conf

However, when you do that, remember to correct some `.conf` files as they ain't
enclosed in a pair of `IfModule` tag.
