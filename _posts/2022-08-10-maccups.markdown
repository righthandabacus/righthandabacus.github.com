It is quite a surprise that if you have a HP color laser printer, and you're
trying to use the PCL protocol to print, you will only print in black and
white. If it is print using PostScript language, you can get the color. There
is not an option for the PCL driver to choose between outputing mono and color,
although the printer supports both. To fix, there is an instruction on github gist:

<https://gist.github.com/mrmanc/0182c6b86d68361c6e35>

Basically the steps are the following:

1. Get a PPD file from http://www.openprinting.org/driver/pxlcolor
2. Turn on CUPS web interface by the command `cupsctl WebInterface=yes`
3. Use the CUPS web interface, instead of the System Preferences dialog, to add a printer. Only from there, you can provide a PPD file for the printer.
4. Viola

Always, `lpstat` is your friend to see the printers in command line.
