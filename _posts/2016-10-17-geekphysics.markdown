My leisure reading.

This book tries to answer hypothetical question like how much banana needed to
generate enough power for a house (by the fact that banana contains potassium
and some potassium isotope is radioactive, which be treated as energy source).
In fact, you don't need to learn much about physics to answer those questions.
Mostly, you need Newtonian mechanics (velocity, acceleration, gravitation,
pressure, kinetic and potential energy), some fluid mechanics (buoyancy), and
that's it.

The hardest part of answering those questions are the constants of physical
qualities, and that's also the greatest take away of reading this book:
<http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/>, the engineering toolbox, where you can
find a lot of them. The author also seems to like using the [Tracker Video
Analysis](http://www.cabrillo.edu/~dbrown/tracker/webstart/) software a lot, to
measure time and distance from video to deduce speed and accelearation. An
alternative link to the software is
