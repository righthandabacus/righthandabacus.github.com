Power architecture is a RISC architecture with 4-byte instruction set. It was
developed by the AIM --- Apple, IBM and Motorola. The semiconductor products
sector of Motorola became Freescale in 2004 and hence the Power architecture
processor is created by Freescale now.

The Freescale Power Architecture cores is named as "e200", "e300", "e500",
"e700" and "e800". The one used in Thecus N1200 is using the "e300" core. It is
a PowerPC core in 32-bit.

The model in Thecus N1200 is MPC8347. The MPC83xx series supports up to 667 MHz
clock with Gigabit ethernet.
