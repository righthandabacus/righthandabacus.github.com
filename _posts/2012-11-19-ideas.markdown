Ways to think of ideas for a start-up: From Wesley Tansey's [blog post](http://wesleytansey.com/how-to-find-startup-ideas/)

  - Repurpose
    Take a service or approach applied to one market, and apply it to another.
  - Digitize
    Take content or functionality that exists only in a legacy form and put it online or in an app.
  - Automate
    Take a task that seems tedious and currently requires humans and automate it away.
  - Unify
    Create a common platform that ties together proprietary solutions or providers.
  - Componentize
    Take a piece of functionality that people currently implement themselves and make it
    a reusable component.
  - Connect
    Transform a situation where people are isolated or lonely by connecting them in a novel way.
  - Catalyze
    Encourage people in a community to generate data that would otherwise be less
    structured or available.

Probably this is also the way towards creativity.
