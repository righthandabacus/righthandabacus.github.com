Extension of a [previous paper](/2011-04-16-baaz09-dctraffic). Brief read.
Following are the summary from the paper's introduction:

  - In a data center, most flow are in small size (in terms of bytes transferred) and short (within a second)
  - Number of flows active per second is well under 10K per rack
  - Traffic is ON/OFF in nature with properties fits some (lognormal/weibull) heavy-tail distribution
  - In cloud, majority (80%) of traffic stays in a rack; in university/private enterprises, majority (40-90%)
    traverses network
  - Link utilization is significant only in cores, but set of heavily utilized links are time-varying
  - At any time, heavily utilized core links is less than 25% of the total core links
  - Primary cause of packet loss is due to momentary spikes
