This paper studies the problem of TCP in-cast in 802.1Qau network environment. This paper reveals that,

  - TCP with RTO shortened (~10ms) can improve in-cast
  - QCN cannot solve in-cast. Sometimes it worsens the scenario
  - If QCN do sampling more frequent (e.g. sample every packet), the in-cast problem is mitigated
  - When timeout occurs, it would be good if the rate increment in AI phase is smaller, so that when RTO expires, there would not be a big burst

The paper then implements such modification in ns2 and shows the improvement.
