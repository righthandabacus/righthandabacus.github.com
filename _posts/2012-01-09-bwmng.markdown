The tool `bwm-ng` is the bandwidth monitoring tool that I frequently used. From
time to time, I wondered how the bandwidth is measured. I digged up the code to
find it out today. It is based on a periodic pooling of network resources for
the byte count. The following is the pseudocode of its algorithm:

```
newCount = Pool_NIC_for_byte_count();
nowTime = Now();
instantBw = (newCount - oldCount) / (nowTime - lastTime);
oldCount = newCount;
lastTime = nowTime;
append_to_list(instantBw);
while (list_size() > N) {
    remove_from_list();
}
reportBw = average_of_list();
```

This algorithm is run periodically, thus the sampling time (i.e. nowTime above) is regularly spaced.

Thus, it resolved my wonder: The reported bandwidth is fluctuating, as no
filtering (e.g. EWMA) is done and the list length (N) is quite short compared to
the sampling frequency. But this reported bandwidth data is accurate in the
sense that it really compute the bytes/time in a sliding window.
