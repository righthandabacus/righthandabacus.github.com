List of Dwarfs (7 dwarfs, later expanded into 13 motifs):

  - Dense Linear Algebra
  - Sparse Linear Algebra
  - Spectral Methods
  - N-Body Methods
  - Structured Grids
  - Unstructured Grids
  - MapReduce
  - Combinational Logic
  - Graph Traversal
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Backtrack and Branch-and-Bound
  - Graphical Models
  - Finite State Machines

The above are *the parallel motifs* (Source and more detail: [Dwarf Mine, from Berkeley](http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Dwarfs)), i.e. a collection of algorithm families that are particularly important in parallel programming. The reason for having these motifs is because doing parallel programming well is hard: Hard to code, hard to understand, hard to analyze, hard to debug, and hard to supply input data (because of the parallelism).

[Here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualizeparallel/archive/2009/12/21/overview-of-the-parallel-dwarfs-project-on-codeplex.aspx) gives one example for each of the 13 motifs:

  - Dense Matrix Algebra: Matrix Multiply
  - Sparse Matrix Algebra: Matrix Vector Multiply
  - Spectral Methods: 2D FFT
  - N-Body Methods
  - Structured Grid: Laplace's equation with Dirichlet's conditions on the square
  - Unstructured Grid: 2D Iterative Triangular Grid
  - MapReduce: well, MapReduce
  - Combinational Logic: Popcount on a binary string
  - Graph Traversal: Depth First Search
  - Dynamic Programming: 0/1 Knapsack Problem
  - Backtrack and Branch-and-Bound: Traveling Salesman problem
  - Graphical Models: Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models
  - Finite State Machines: Pattern Matching on Strings
