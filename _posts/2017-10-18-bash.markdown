Let `$string` be a string.

Substring extraction:

  - `${string:n}` extract string from position `n` onward, which `n`$\ge 0$.
  - `${string:n:m}` extract string from position `n` onward for `m` characters, which `n`$\ge 0$ and `m`$\ge 1$.

Substring replacement:

  - `${string/pattern/replacement}` replace only the first match. The pattern is a globbing and replacement is a text string.
  - `${string//pattern/replacement}` replace with all matches.
  - `${string/#pattern/replacement}` replace only if pattern at beginning of the string.
  - `${string/%pattern/replacement}` replace only if pattern at end of the string.

Substring removal:

  - `${string##pattern}` delete the longest match of substring from the front of string, pattern is a globbing
  - `${string%%pattern}` delete the longest match of substring from the back of string
  - `${string#pattern}` delete the shortest match of substring from the front of string
  - `${string%pattern}` delete the shortest match of substring from the back of string

String length:

  - `${#string}` gives the number of characters in string

With these, a basename command can be replaced by the following

```bash
PATHNAME=/path/to/myfile.pdf
FILENAME=${PATHNAME##*/} # myfile.pdf
BASENAME=${FILENAME%.pdf} # myfile
```
