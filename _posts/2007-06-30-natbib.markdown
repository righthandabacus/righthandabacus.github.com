When writing a sociological paper rather than a science paper, they prefer to
use the American Psychology Association (APA) format for citations. In order to
make this format work, you must include the LaTeX module `natbib` so that the
author names can be handled correctly.

But `natbib` is a re-implementation of `\cite`, so following lists what can be
done when `natbib` is included:

## Options at \usepackage

Syntax:

    \usepackage[comma-separated-options]{natbib}

Option list:
  * style of presentation:
    * `authoryear` (default): author-year type
    * `numbers`: author and a sequence number
    * `super`: author and a superscripted sequence number
    * `nonamebreak`: no line-break within a citation
  * brackets:
    * `round` (default): use parenthesis
    * `square`: use square brackets
    * `curly`: use braces
    * `angle`: use angle brackets
  * style of multiple citation:
    * `sort`: sort by order of appearance in bibliographic list
    * `sort&compress`:
         and additionally, compress numerics like IEEE (if applicable)
    * `longnamesfirst`:
         first one in full author list and subsequent in abbreviated list
    * `colon` (default): use colons for separation
    * `comma`: use comma for separation
  * bibliographic list:
    * `sectionbib`:
         use `\section*` instead of `\chapter*` for `\thebibliography`
         (see chapterbib package)

## Commands

Citation commands:
  * `\citet`  - name et al (year)
  * `\citep`  - (name et al, year)
  * `\citet*` - name and name and name (year)
  * `\citep*` - (name and name and name, year)

Optionally, you can put options to append some text before and after the citation, e.g.

    \citep[see][sec 1]{tag}

gives: (see somebody, year, sec 1)

Alternative citation commands:

  * `\citealt` - same as `\citet`, but without parenthesis
  * `\citealp` - same as `\citep`, but without parenthesis
  * `\citealt*` - same as `\citet*`, but without parenthesis
  * `\citealp*` - same as `\citep*`, but without parenthesis
  * `\citeauthor` - just the author
  * `\citeauthor*` - just the author in full list
  * `\citeyear` - just the year without parenthesis
  * `\citeyearpar` - just the year in parenthesis
