This paper challenges the idea of using, say, fat-tree in DCN because in a DCN, network bisection bandwidth and low diameter are just part of the criteria. We still have to consider resilience to failure, wiring complexity, and energy consumption.

In the paper, the Borg topology is proposed (3-dimensional hypercube of k servers in each dimension). Then, the paper shows how a topology like this allows a efficient implementation of services, routing, communication, failure detection, etc. Thus in the title of the paper, the term "integrate" means the design that consider everything together as one piece, rather than planned separately.
