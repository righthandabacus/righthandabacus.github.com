Interviewer (hiring manager) have unconscious questions to be answered by each candidate
- Unconscious questions: achievement, process, creativity, relationships, aggressiveness, likeability
- Managers aren’t even aware of asking the unconscious questions

Four types of managers:
- Power tripper: disorganized and uninformed
  - Extra hard on candidates to prove their own intellectual prowess
- Defensive croucher: Motivated by fear
  - Mediocre managers, fear people could do their jobs better
- Method man: Relying on the latest interviewing trend
- Rogue agent: following a secret agenda
  - Who haven’t had specific interview training
  - Base the interview on untested logic or idiosyncratic factors
  - One bad experience with someone from a certain background → generalized
    that experience to all people with that background

Eight step plan: REAPRICH [ch1]
- Results
- Energy
- Attitude
- Process
- Relationships
- Interview the interviewer
- Close the interviewer
- Humanity

Critical Commonsense Interview Preparation: [ch2]
- Who will be interviewing you?
- Background of the company? Competitors?
- Who will you be working for and with?
- Polish up CV
- Dress nearly and professionally
- Be on time
- Ask for business cards
- Send thank-you notes

REA in REAPRICH: Results, Enthusiasm, and a Positive Attitude [ch3]
- Result: differentiate you from everyone else
  - Get a collection of 6-10 achievements you’ve had that you can list in 90 second or less
  - Projects ahead of time and under budget? Developed a system? Overachieve in athletics?
  - Don’t wait for invitation to speak of results
- Energy and Enthusiasm: People sometimes get jobs based on energy and charisma alone
  - Energy and excitement you bring to the start of the interview sets the tone for the rest of your meeting
  - The outward presentation
- Attitude: Speaks your inner landscape
  - The intrinsic motivation
  - Managers want you to show grit, tenacity, focus and delivery
  - “No jerk” policy (Jack Welch)


Process explains how you achieved your results.  A good manager will think
about how your process may work within the context of his own job [ch4]

Relationships: [ch5]
- You’re able to build them: Can you play nicely with other people?
- Sustain the relationship or whether you’re someone who burn bridges
- You’ll bring new and beneficial relationships to other company (customers, suppliers, vendors, or others)

Interviewing the interviewer: Prepare a minimum of 2 questions, preferably 4-5 to ask the hiring manager [ch6]

Time to demonstrate a depth of expertise or knowledge that may go dper in probing the manager’s mind
- Tell me about some of your most successful people. What’s made them great?
- How can I help your team? What is the best way my skill could add value?
- If you hired me today, what would you have me help you and your team within the first 3 months?
- What are great things about this company that I would only hear from you and may not find in my own research?

Avoid leaving negative emotional state, do not ask for negative news [ch6]
- If the manager brings up a negative topic, respond as briefly and neutrally as possible and move on
- Focus, listen, and maintain eye contact

Closing the interviewer: ask for the job [ch7]
- Closing is a familiar concept in sales, you’re selling yourself to a potential employer
- Closing process can happen on 5-6 levels, it’s a process, not a moment
  - You want that person to move you forward to the next step
     - “Can you tell me about what happens next in our process?”
     - “Are you recommending me for hire?”
     - “Are you going to offer me the job today?”
  - If noncommittal: “Are there any areas in my background concern you?”

Keeping it real: The importance of humanity [ch8]
- Interview finish in 30-35 mins
- Something interesting in the picture (boating, karate, etc.)?
