This paper describes the DUAL (diffusion update algorithm), which is used in Cisco's EIGRP. The algorithm guarantees loop-free routing at any time by imposing a constraint (feasibility condition) on route update. The feasibility condition is a conservative condition in the sense that it rejects some legitimate route update so that loops can be totally avoided.
