Summary at: [1] <http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/a-new-way-to-solve-linear-equations/>

Original paper by Prasad Raghavendra at: [2] <http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/linsystems.pdf>

This is to solve a linear equation system $$Ax=b$$ over a finite field
$$\mathbb{F}_q$$. The finite field is has a finite size of $$q$$ (a prime), we can
think of it as integers 0 to $$q-1$$, with the addition and multiplication are
done in modulus $$q$$. Matrix $$A$$ is of order $$m\times n$$.

The algorithm to solve the problem is as follows: It first takes $$N=Cn$$ random
vectors from $$\mathbb{F}|n_q$$, make it into a set $$S_0$$. Then filter $$S_0$$ to
find those who can satisfy the first row of $$Ax=b$$. The satisfying random
vectors are then "recombined": Select $$q-1$$ of them randomly and sum up to give
a new vector. Repeat this random select and sum up process to produce $$N$$
vectors. These $$N$$ vectors are make into a set $$S_1$$, then applied to the
second row of $$Ax=b$$. The filtered set at the last row are the solutions for
the linear equation.

Note that, in the finite field, there could be infinitely many solutions for a
linear system. Therefore a set of solutions is produced. The original paper [2]
gives the analysis on the size of $$N$$ required and the performance bound.
