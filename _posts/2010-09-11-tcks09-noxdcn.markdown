This paper argues whether we are necessary to use specialized solution for data center network.

VL2 and PortLand are specialized solutions for data center networks. In this
paper, the authors argue that we do not need specialized solution but just need
to configure the general network management technology. This paper use NOX
(Network Operating System, by Berkeley) as the example of general network
management technology. It comprises of a centralized controller(s) and
manageable switches. The controller can install forwarding rules into those
switches, which instruct the switch on how to forward a packet and whether any
fields in the header should be changed upon being forwarded.

The paper demonstrates how we can configure NOX to perform the load balancing
function exactly like VL2. And argues that, the resources consumed (i.e.
forwarding table capacity) using NOX is smaller than VL2.
