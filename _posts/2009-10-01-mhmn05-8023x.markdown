It models TCP flows interacting with Ethernet Pause (802.3x) in two tandem queues as a Markov process. The TCP's AIMD is modeled as a MMPP process with $$N$$ states with monotonically decreasing sending rate. The AIMD is modeled as a move of the state $$a\to a-1$$ (rate increase) or $$a\to 2a$$ (rate decrease). The Markove chain is modeled as a four-tuple $$(i,j,k,a)$$ where $$i$$ and $$j$$ are the number of packets in the two queues in tandem (with upper-bound $$B_1$$ and $$B_2$$); and $$k$$ is a binary value denote the "up" and "down" state of the second queue, as whether pause is in effect or not; and $$a$$ is the state of TCP's MMPP process.

The paper assumes Poisson arrival of packets and exponential service of queues. Paper also did a simulation with NS2 and OMNeT++. It found that:

  - Hop-by-hop flow control improves goodput as RTT increases. Because TCP recovers effectively as RTT is small and HbH control has less room for optimization
  - Threshold for sending HbH control shall not be close to buffer size so that you may still have room to catch the burst
