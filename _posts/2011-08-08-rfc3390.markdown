Instead of what RFC2581 describes, the initial congestion window is increased to 2-4 MSS:

```
min (4*MSS, max (2*MSS, 4380 bytes))
```

For the MTU of 1500 bytes, the MSS is 1460 bytes. Then the initial cwnd is 3 MSS. The initial cwnd setting is actually according to this table:

| MSS                         | max cwnd   |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| MSS $\le$ 1095 bytes        | 4 MSS      |
| 1095 $<$ MSS $<$ 2190 bytes | 4380 bytes |
| 2190 bytes $\le$ MSS        | 2 MSS      |
