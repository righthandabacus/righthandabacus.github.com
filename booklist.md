- Introduction to Information Retrieval - Manning et al. <http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html>
- The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition - Steven Skiena <http://www.algorist.com/>

- Casella, G. and Berger, R.L. (2001). "Statistical Inference" Duxbury Press.
- Ferguson, T. (1996). "A Course in Large Sample Theory" Chapman & Hall/CRC.\\
  For a slightly more advanced book that's quite clear on mathematical techniques, the following book is quite good:
- Lehmann, E. (2004). "Elements of Large-Sample Theory" Springer.\\
  You'll need to learn something about asymptotics at some point, and a good starting place is:
- Gelman, A. et al. (2003). "Bayesian Data Analysis" Chapman & Hall/CRC.\\
  Those are all frequentist books. You should also read something Bayesian:
- Robert, C. and Casella, G. (2005). "Monte Carlo Statistical Methods" Springer.\\
  and you should start to read about Bayesian computation:
- Grimmett, G. and Stirzaker, D. (2001). "Probability and Random Processes" Oxford.\\
  On the probability front, a good intermediate text is:
- Pollard, D. (2001). "A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability" Cambridge.\\
  At a more advanced level, a very good text is the following:
- The standard advanced textbook is Durrett, R. (2005). "Probability: Theory and Examples" Duxbury.
- Bertsimas, D. and Tsitsiklis, J. (1997). "Introduction to Linear Optimization" Athena.\\
  Machine learning research also reposes on optimization theory. A good starting book on linear optimization that will prepare you for convex optimization:
- Boyd, S. and Vandenberghe, L. (2004). "Convex Optimization" Cambridge.
- Golub, G., and Van Loan, C. (1996). "Matrix Computations" Johns Hopkins.\\
  Getting a full understanding of algorithmic linear algebra is also important. At some point you should feel familiar with most of the material in
- Cover, T. and Thomas, J. "Elements of Information Theory" Wiley.\\
  It's good to know some information theory. The classic is:

Proof Technique
- Velleman's "How to Prove It"
- Gries and Schneider's "A Logical Approach to Discrete Math"

Math
- Calculus (best "lite" book - Calculus by Strang (free download), best "heavy" books - (d) Calculus by Spivak, (e) Principles of Mathematical Analysis a.k.a "Baby Rudin")
- Discrete Math (ALADM above + (g) a good book on Algorithms, Cormen will do - though working through it comprehensively is ... hard!
- Linear Algebra (First work through Strang's book, then (i) Axler's)
- Probability (see Bradford's very comprehensive recommendations) and
- Statistics (I would reccomend Devore and Peck for the total beginner but it is a damn expensive book. So hit a library or get a bootlegged copy to see if it suits you before buying a copy, see brad's list for advanced stuff.)
- Information Theory (MacKay's book is freely available online)

Basic AI
- AIMA 3d Edition (I prefer this to Mitchell)

Machine Learning
- "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop,
- Elements of Statistical Learning" (free download).
- Neural Network Design by Hagan Demuth and Kneale,
- Neural Networks, A Comprehensive Foundation (2nd edition) - By Haykin (there is a newer edition out but I don't know anything about that, this is the one I used)
- Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition ( Bishop).

At this point you are in good shape to read any papers in NN. My reccomendations - anything by Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton. Both do amazing research.
Reinforcement Learning
- Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction by Barto and Sutton (follow up with "Recent Advances In reinforcement Learning" (PDF) which is an old paper but a GREAT introduction to HierarchicalReinforcement learning)
- Neuro Dynamic Programming by Bertsekas

Computer Vision
- Introductory Techniques for 3-D Computer Vision, by Emanuele Trucco and Alessandro Verri.
- An Invitation to 3-D Vision by Y. Ma, S. Soatto, J. Kosecka, S.S. Sastry. (warning TOUGH!!)

Robotics.
- Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning) - not about robotics per se but useful to understand the next book
- Probabilistic Robotics (Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Agents) by Thrun, Burgard and Fox
